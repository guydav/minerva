The End of Average,Cognitive Process,Closing Program,Basic Understanding,Todd Roseæ,"Are you above average? Is your child an A student? Every day we are measured against averages, and weÍre judged on how far from them we fall. Indeed, measuring ourselves against the average is so ingrained in our consciousness that we donÍt even question it. But what if thatÍs not the best way to judge success and failure? In Todd RoseÍs new book ñThe End of Average,î he demonstrates that no one is average. And that, he argues, has enormous practical consequences. While we know people learn in distinctive ways, schools and businesses have been designed around the so-called ñaverage person.î This model ignores our differences and fails at recognizing talent. ItÍs time to change it.",,,
