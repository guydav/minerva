A Proving Ground for Education,Data Analytics,Solo,Basic Understanding,Tom Kane (Center for Education Policy Research at Harvard University),"The rate of progress in education will depend not only on our ability to create innovations, but will depend much more on our ability to learn what innovations work. Yet evaluations are costly, slow, and they don_t provide real-time data on implementation. For this reason, education leaders rarely test new ideas before rolling them out to teachers and students broadly. We need a _proving ground_ to easily learn what works and how.

The Courage to Learn,Educational Equality,Solo,Field Experience,Ilna Colemere (University of Texas at San Antonio),"Knowledge is the ultimate form of empowerment.  When motivation, the silent ego of learning, is coupled with empowerment, it becomes the language of confidence. One voice asking for knowledge is common but one voice speaking on behalf of many is powerful. The hunger to learn provided the foundation for a basic computer skills program for 125 housekeepers.  By choice or circumstance their formal education was interrupted, leaving many to languish in the squalor of their presumed intellectual limitation. In 3 years, they have learned to navigate the tools and features of computers. The uniqueness of this experience lies in the wish they had, no matter the obstacle, learning to learn again.","Define the architecture of the program thru the constructs of accomplishment, mastery, and the elegant productive skills of the program pathfinders.","Outline the transformational classroom landscape of collegiality, support and respect as central to the narrative of success.","Describe the accountability of success as a benefit of the granting of a wish.",motivation,goal setting,courage,,,,http://www.slideshare.net/lix578/2-the-courage-to-learn
The Future of Global Education,Educational Equality,Solo,Basic Understanding,David Long (Tuscany Associates),"As we look at the past 50 years of education, we see a dramatic, worldwide increase in elementary to post secondary educational attainment. Looking broadly at international and national data sets over the past 50 years reveals both the dramatic growth in education and remaining challenges. These data demonstrate a shift away from traditionally structured classrooms towards interdisciplinary learning that emphasizes creativity, critical thinking, and communications. This shift, lead by high end public, private, and charter schools will fundamentally change the role of teachers, students, assessments, and learning outcomes.

Why Disrupt Higher Ed Now?!,Educational Equality,Solo,Basic Understanding,Troy Williams (Macmillan New Ventures),"US Higher Ed has a product that does not work, ridiculous costs, and an antiquated business model.
