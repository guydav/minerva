            <h2>South by Southwest EDU & Minerva - Data Exploration - Mike, is this a good title?</h2>
            <p>
            For the last few weeks, SxSWedu has been working with a group of students from Minerva Schools at KGI to visualize the trends in education that this conference showcases. An innovative new four year degree program during which students live and study in seven world cities, Minerva is interested in this because we are at the forefront of innovation in higher education.
            </p>
            <p>
            Our students were given a data set of all the program submissions made to SxSWedu, with descriptions and three tags. The three tags were chosen by the submitter to signify the salient features of their proposed talk or session. We analyzed the frequencies of single words, bigrams (two-word phrases), and trigrams (three-word phrases), and found the top one hundred combinations.

            The most common themes in these submissions were Higher Education, Design Thinking and 21st Century Skills. We asked students what they think is important about these three threads, and they had some interesting insights.

            Then, even more interestingly, we re-ran this process for the accepted submissions. We discovered that “Student Success”, “Personalized Learning” and “Virtual Reality” moved much further up the list of most common topics within session descriptions. This is very interesting because it shows that these topics fit in with the ethos of SxSWedu, and demonstrates the value of these ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, the topic tags also shifted slightly. “Entrepreneurship”, “Personalized” and “Global” leaped up the list, and became some of the most talked about topics at the conference. In order to show the connections between the accepted submission tags, we designed a second tag network graph.

            For us as students, this project has been really interesting as a way to learn about the conference, and to engage in some project based learning of our own. These data visualizations show the most central and exciting undercurrents in education right now. They demonstrate the dedication and interest of SxSWedu conference-goers, and indicate the changes you will inspire in Austin.
        </p>
        <p>
            As students, we are honoured and excited to be a part of SxSWedu this year. We gathered some student voices. We asked students what they are looking forward to, what their aims for the conference are, and who they will try to meet. We look forward to meeting you all soon,
